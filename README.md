## Description

Metadata Editor is a program capable of reading and editing files metadata
easily. The project is the implemented GUI itself. The responsible for editing
and writing metadata into files is the [exiftool program][exiftool_link],
written by Phil Harvey.

For now, this application is available in Linux systems only (and probably also
in others Unix-based systems). But a windows version is about to come if
possible.

## Dependencies

* exiftool. It must be installed in your system and available in your path.

## Installation

I'll list step to step on how to install this program.

## Basic Usage

To an extent, this application is very straight to the point. Much of its'
functionality is easy to grasp quickly. These are some examples of what's
possible to do with Metadata Editor.

### Reading Files Metadata
### Writing Custom Metadata into a File

## Authors
